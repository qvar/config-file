# ==============================================================
#  BIND bind - defaults
# ==============================================================
# The "bind" command assign keys to (internal) commands
# SCREEN checks all the keys you type; you type the key
# which is known as the "command character" then SCREEN
# eats this key, too, and checks whether this key is
# "bound" to a command.  If so then SCREEN will execute it.
#
# The command "bind" allows you to chose which keys
# will be assigned to the commands.
#
# Some commands are bound to several keys -
# usually to both some letter and its corresponding
# control key combination, eg the command
# "(create) screen" is bound to both 'c' and '^C'.
#
# The following list shows the default bindings:
#
# break     ^B b
# clear     C
# colon     :
# copy      ^[ [
# detach    ^D d
# digraph   ^V
